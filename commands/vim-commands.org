  - :enew     # open new buffer in current window
** selecting
  - :b#         # switch to other buffer (can open closed buffers)
  - :ls         # list buffers
  - :b<num>     # open buffer <num>
  - :bp         # open previous buffer
  - :bn         # open next buffer
** deleting
  - :bd#      # delete other buffer
  - :bw#      # wipeout other buffer
  - maybe try this plugin: https://github.com/moll/vim-bbye
* Moving around
** Screen position / scrolling
  - zt        # current line to top

* Vim command line editing
  - q:        # open command line history like a buffer, CR to execute
  - :<C-f>    # Ctrl-F while in command line opens buffer
* Search & Replace
** Highlighting

     out if there is a fix for that.

    # lines text to an external program and have the output replace the lines

  - '<,'>!python -c "import json, sys; print json.dumps(json.load(sys.stdin), indent=2)"
    # two space indent
  - for JSON consider installing jq: <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/>
  - test JSON:
[
{ "hi": 3, "there": [1,2,3] },
{ "hi": 3, "there": [1,2,3] },
{ "hi": 3, "there": [1,2,3] }
]
  - :r !ls        # paste results of external command into the buffer
  - :0r !ls       # paste results before first line of file (after line 0)
  - :-r !ls       # paste results before the current line

** Copy filename and line number to system clipboard
   - :let @+=expand("%") . ':' . line(".")
* How to work with files in VIM
** :set hidden
      If you don't have this set already, then do so. It makes vim work like every
      other multiple-file editor on the planet. You can have edited buffers that
      aren't visible in a window somewhere.
** Use :bn, :bp, :b #, :b name, and ctrl-6 to switch between buffers. I like
      ctrl-6 myself (alone it switches to the previously used buffer, or #ctrl-6
      switches to buffer number #).
** Use :ls to list buffers, or a plugin like MiniBufExpl or BufExplorer.

** Buffer manipulation
  - :bp       # previous buffer in numeric order
  - :bn       # next buffer in numeric order
  - :ls       # list buffers (not hidden ones)
  - :b<n>     # open buffer <n>
  - :b#       # last used buffer
  - :bd#      # delete (last) buffer - still in history
  - :bw#      # wipeout (last) buffer - totally get rid of it
  - :%bd      # delete all buffers - opens a new empty buffer
  - :%bd:e#   # delete all buffers, reopen last file
  - :%bd:e#:bd#   # delete all buffers, reopen last file, close empty buffer
* Vim distraction free
** Manually
   - :vnew            # empty buffer new vert split
   - :new             # empty buffer new horz split
   - :enew            # empty buffer
   - :setl nonumber   # remove line numbers
   - C-W r    # rotate panes down/right
   - C-w x    # swap with window on the right
   - C-W H    # move pane far left
* Vim variables
  - set shiftwidth=2          # set value
  - setlocal shiftwidth=2     # set value for this buffer only
  - set shiftwidth?           # show value
  - verbose set shiftwidth?   # show where variable last set
  - set shiftwidth&           # restore default
  - setlocal shiftwidth&      # restore default
