* How to work with files in VIM
** :set hidden
      If you don't have this set already, then do so. It makes vim work like every
      other multiple-file editor on the planet. You can have edited buffers that
      aren't visible in a window somewhere.
** Use :bn, :bp, :b #, :b name, and ctrl-6 to switch between buffers. I like
      ctrl-6 myself (alone it switches to the previously used buffer, or #ctrl-6
      switches to buffer number #).
** Use :ls to list buffers, or a plugin like MiniBufExpl or BufExplorer.
* Vim variables
** :set shiftwidth=2          # set value
** :setlocal shiftwidth=2     # set value for this buffer only
** :set shiftwidth?           # show value
** :verbose set shiftwidth?   # show where variable last set
